Upstash Vector has several features and enhancements planned for its roadmap. These include:

**1. Improved Availability and Performance with Replication**

Currently, each index resides in a single replica. This means that if the replica becomes unavailable, so does the index.

To address this, Upstash Vector is planning to introduce replication. This will involve creating multiple read replicas of each index, ensuring:

- **High Availability:** Even if one replica fails, others will remain accessible, maintaining index availability.
- **Reduced Latency:** Replicas can be placed in different regions, bringing the index closer to clients and reducing latency for geographically distributed users.
