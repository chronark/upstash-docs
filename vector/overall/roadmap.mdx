title: Roadmap

There are several features and improvements planned in the Upstash Vector roadmap.
Some of them are:

- **Filtering with Metadata**: Upstash Vector allows upserting and fetching metadata objects alongside
vectors. See [Metadata Feature](../overall/features#metadata). 
But currently it's not possible to filter based on that metadata. With metadata based filtering, it will 
be possible to further enchange vectoer search results.

- **Replication**: Currently each index resides in a single replica. When that replica fails or becomes unreachable
for some reason, index won't be available until the replica becomes available again.
Another problem is, if the index is used from multiple regions, latency will be high when index is accessed from a distant location.
Adding more read replicas will make index closer to the clients.

- **Namespaces**: Namespaces is a mechanism to divide the index into multiple partitions. Each namespace is
a subset of the whole index and is isolated from others partitions/namespaces. Namespaces is used to divide 
the index into more granular subsets and can be used to create more performant indexing or for indexing multiple 
tenants data.
