title: "Query Data"
description: "Queries the approximate nearest neighbors of a raw text data after embedding it."
api: "POST https://{endpoint}/query-data/{namespace}"
authMethod: "bearer"

<Warning>
  To use this endpoint, the index must be created with an [embedding model](/vector/features/embeddingmodels).
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Query will run against the default namespace by default.
  You can use a different namespace by specifying it in the request path.
</Tip>

## Request

<ParamField body="data" name="data" type="string" required>
  The raw text data to embed and query.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="topK" type="number" required default="10">
  The total number of the vectors that you want to receive as a query
  result. The response will be sorted based on the distance metric score,
  and at most `topK` many vectors will be returned.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="includeMetadata" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether to include the metadata of the vectors in the response, if any.
  It is recommended to set this to `true` to easily identify vectors.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="includeVectors" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether to include the vector values in the response.
  It is recommended to set this to `false` as the vector values can be
  quite big, and not needed most of the time.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="filter" type="string" default="">
  [Metadata filter](/vector/features/filtering) to apply.
</ParamField>

## Path

<ParamField path="namespace" type="string" default="">
  The namespace to use.
  When no namespace is specified, the default namespace will be used.
</ParamField>

## Response

<Note>
  The score is normalized to always be between 0 and 1.
  The closer the score is to 1, the more similar the vector is to the query vector.
  This does not depend on the distance metric you use.
</Note>

<ResponseField name="Scores" type="Object[]">
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
      The id of the vector.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
      The similarity score of the vector, calculated based on the distance metric of your index.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="vector" type="number[]">
      The vector value.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="metadata" type="Object">
      The metadata of the vector, if any.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
