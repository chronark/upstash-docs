</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="pendingVectorCount" type="number" required>
  The number of vectors in the index, that are still processing
  and not ready to use.
  This is the total number of pending vectors across all namespaces.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="indexSize" type="number" required>
  The total size of the index, in **bytes**.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="dimension" type="number" required>
