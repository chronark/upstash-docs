title: Getting Started
---

If you do not have a vector database already, follow [these steps](../overall/getstarted.mdx) to create one.

In the database details section of the Upstash Console, scroll down to `Connect` section and select the `cURL` tab. You can simply copy the curl expression and run on your terminal.

```shell
curl https://better-dodo-20522-us1-vector.upstash.io/upsert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id": "id1", "vector": [0.87,0.99,0.65,0.64,0.15,0.15,0.76,0.16]}'
```

## Response

REST API returns a JSON response. When command execution is successful, response JSON will have a single result field and its value will contain the Redis response.

Example:

```json
{ "result": "Success" }
```

When command execution is not successful, response JSON will have a single error field and its value will contain the error message.

Example:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized: Invalid auth token",
  "status": 401
}
```
