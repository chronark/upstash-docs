## Introduction

Upstash supports OAuth 2.0 the industry-standard protocol for authorization.
OAuth 2.0 designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted
by other apps on behalf of a user.

This guide explains how to integrate Upstash OAuth 2.0 flow for the
authorization and resource management. Upstash uses Auth0 for the
authentication.

<Info>
  Before starting development to integrate Upstash into your product, please
  send an email to support@upstash.com for further assistance and guidance.
</Info>

## General Flow (User Perspective - High Level)

1. User will click `Connect Upstash` button in GUI/Web App ,
2. The app will initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow, which will open a new browser page
   displaying the `Upstash Login Page`.
3. Users will either log in or sign up for their Upstash account.
4. Browser window will be redirected to `Your account has been connected` Page
   then browser window will automatically close.
5. After the user returns to the Web/GUI Application, they will see that their
   Upstash Account is now connected.

## Technical Design (SPA - Regular Web Application)

1. Users click `Connect Upstash` button from Web App.
2. Web App initiate Upstash OAuth 2.0 flow. Web App can use
   [Auth0 native libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries).

<Note>
  Please reach support@upstash.com to receive client id and callback url.
</Note>

3. After user returns from OAuth 2.0 flow then web app will have JWT token. Web
   App can generate Developer Api key:

```bash
curl https://api.upstash.com/apikey \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "name" : "APPNAME_API_KEY_TIMESTAMP" }'
```

4. Web App need to save Developer Api Key to the backend.

## Technical Design ( GUI Apps )

</Frame>

1. Users click `Connect Upstash` button from GUI
2. App starts listening `localhost:3000`
3. App will open new browser:

```
https://auth.upstash.com/authorize?response_type=code&audience=upstash-api&scope=offline_access&client_id=XXXXXXXXXX&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000
```

<Note>Please reach support@upstash.com to receive client id.</Note>

4. After user authenticated Auth0 will redirect user to
   `localhost:3000/?code=XXXXXX`
5. APP can return some nice html response when Auth0 returns to `localhost:3000`

6. After getting `code` parameter from the URL query, GUI App will make http
   call to the Auth0 code exchange api. Example CURL request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://auth.upstash.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code --data audience=upstash-api' \
  --data 'client_id=XXXXXXXXXXX' \
  --data 'code=XXXXXXXXXXXX' \
  --data 'redirect_uri=localhost:3000'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "XXXXXXXXXX",
  "refresh_token": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
  "scope": "offline_access",
  "expires_in": 172800,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

7. After 6th Step the response will include `access_token`, it has 3 days TTL.
   GUI App will call Upstash API to get a developer api key:

```bash
curl https://api.upstash.com/apikey -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_KEY" -d '{ "name" : "APPNAME_API_KEY_TIMESTAMP" }'
```

8. GUI App will save Developer Api key locally. Then GUI App can call any
   Upstash Developer API [developer.upstash.com/](http://developer.upstash.com/)

## Managing Resources

After obtaining Upstash Developer Api key, App can call Upstash API. For example
[Create Database](https://developer.upstash.com/#create-database-global),
[List Database](https://developer.upstash.com/#list-databases)

App can ask user region information and name of the database then can call
Create Database API.

Example CURL request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.upstash.com/v2/redis/database \
  -u 'EMAIL:API_KEY' \
  -d '{"name":"myredis", "region":"global", "primary_region":"us-east-1", "read_regions":["us-west-1","us-west-2"], "tls": true}'
```
