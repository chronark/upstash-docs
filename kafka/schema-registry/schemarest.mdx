## Register Schema

`POST /subjects/$SUBJECT/versions?normalize=[true/false]`

Registers the schema under given `$SUBJECT` only if the new schema is [compatible](./schemacompatibility).

`normalize` is false by default. If passed, the schema will be normalized.
Normalization enables semantically same but syntactically different schemas to be accounted as the same schema.

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/schema-registry/subjects/$SUBJECT/versions -u myuser:mypass -d '
{
  "schema": "{
    \"type\": \"record\",
    \"name\": \"myRecord\",
    \"fields\":
        [
        {\"type\": \"string\",\"name\": \"field1\"},
        {\"type\": \"int\"   ,\"name\": \"field2\"}
        ]
  }",
  "schemaType": "AVRO"
}'
   ```

**Success Response:**

The schema ID returned as the response:

```json
{"id" : 2}
```

**Fail Response:**

```
- 409 Conflict – Incompatible schema
- 422 Unprocessable Entity
  - Error code 42201 – Invalid schema
- 500 Internal Server Error
  - Error code 50001 – Error in the backend data store
  - Error code 50002 – Operation timed out
  - Error code 50003 – Error while forwarding the request to the primary
```

## Check schema

`POST /subjects/$SUBJECT?normalize=[true/false]&deleted=[true/false]`

Check if the given schema is registered under the `$SUBJECT`. Returns the schema along with subject, version, and schema type.

`normalize` is false by default. If set to `true`, the schema will be normalized.
Normalization enables semantically same but syntactically different schemas to be accounted as the same schema.

`deleted` is false by default. If set to `true`, the soft-deleted schemas under the subject will also be taken into account.
See [Delete Subject](#delete-subject) or [Delete Schema](#delete-schema) for details.

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/schema-registry/my-subject/$SUBJECT -u myuser:mypass -d '
{
  "schema": "{
    \"type\": \"record\",
    \"name\": \"myRecord\",
    \"fields\":
        [
        {\"type\": \"string\",\"name\": \"field1\"},
        {\"type\": \"int\"   ,\"name\": \"field2\"}
        ]
  }",
  "schemaType": "AVRO"
}'

**Success Response:**

```json
{
      "subject": "my-subject",
      "id": 2
      "version": 3
      "schema":
         "

              \"name\": \"myRecord\",
              \"fields\":
                  [
                  {\"type\": \"string\",\"name\": \"field1\"},
                  {\"type\": \"int\"   ,\"name\": \"field2\"}
                  ]
            }",
            "schemaType": "AVRO"
          }
         "
