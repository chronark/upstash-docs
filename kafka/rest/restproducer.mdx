Producer API is used to send one or more messages to the same or multiple Kafka topics.

There are three variants of the Producer API:

1. `GET /produce/$TOPIC/$MESSAGE?key=$KEY`:

    Sends a single message (`$MESSAGE`) to a topic (`$TOPIC`) using HTTP GET. Optionally message key can be
    appended with a query parameter`?key=$KEY`.

    Without message key:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/greetings/hello_kafka -u myuser:mypass
    ```

    With a message key:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/cities/Istanbul?key=city -u myuser:mypass
    ```

    **Response:**

    A single metadata response is returned as JSON. Its structure is:

    ```typescript
    Metadata{
        topic: String,
        partition: Int,
        offset: Long,
        timestamp: Long
    }
    ```

2. `[GET | POST] /produce/$TOPIC`:

    Produces one or more messages to a single topic (`$TOPIC`). Messages are sent using request body as JSON.
    Structure of the message JSON is:

    ```typescript
    Header {key: String, value: String}

    Message{
        partition?: Int,
        timestamp?: Long,
        key?: String,
        value: String,
        headers?: Array<Header>
    }
    ```

    Only `value` field is required. `partition`, `timestamp`, `key` and `headers` fields are optional. When left blank,
    `partition` and `timestamp` fields will be assigned by Kafka brokers.
    It's valid to send a single message or array of messages as JSON.

    - Single message with only value:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/greetings -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '{"value": "hello_kafka"}'
    ```

    - Single message with multiple attributes:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/cities -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '{"partition": 1, "key": "city", "value": "Istanbul", "headers": [{"key": "expire", "value": "1637745834756"}] }'
    ```

    - Multiple messages with only values:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/greetings -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '[
            {"value": "hello_world"},
            {"value": "hello_upstash"},
            {"value": "hello_kafka"}
        ]'
    ```

    - Multiple messages with attributes:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/cities -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '[
            {"partition": 1, "timestamp": 1637745834744, "key": "city", "value": "Istanbul"},
            {"partition": 2, "timestamp": 1637745823147, "key": "city", "value": "London"},
            {"partition": 3, "timestamp": 1637455583829, "key": "city", "value": "Tokyo"},
        ]'
    ```

    **Response:**

    A metadata array response is returned as JSON. Its structure is same as above. Each metadata in the response
    array belongs the message with the same order in the request.

3. `[GET | POST] /produce`:

    Produces one or more messages to a single or multiple topics. Messages are sent using request body as JSON.
    Structure of the message JSON is the same as the above, there's only an additional `topic` field:

    ```typescript
    Message{
        topic: String,
        partition?: Int,
        timestamp?: Long,
        key?: String,
        value: String,
        headers?: Array<Header>
    }
    ```

    Only `topic` and `value` fields are required. `partition`, `timestamp`, `key` and `headers` fields are optional. When left blank,
    `partition` and `timestamp` fields will be assigned by Kafka brokers.
    It's valid to send a single message or array of messages as JSON.

    - Single message:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '{"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_kafka"}'
    ```

    - Multiple messages for a single topic:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '[
            {"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_world"},
            {"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_upstash"},
            {"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_kafka"}
        ]'
    ```

    - Multiple messages to multiple topics:

    ```shell
    curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce -u myuser:mypass \
        -d '[
            {"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_world"},
            {"topic": "greetings", "value": "hello_upstash"},
            {"topic": "cities", "partition": 1, "value": "Istanbul"},
            {"topic": "cities", "partition": 2, "value": "London"},
            {"topic": "cities", "partition": 3, "value": "Tokyo"},
        ]'
    ```

    **Response:**

    A metadata array response is returned as JSON. Its structure is same as above. Each metadata in the response
    array belongs the message with the same order in the request.

<Info>
    Producer API works with `acks=all` [producer
    configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation.html#producerconfigs_acks),
    which means the topic partition's leader will wait for the all in-sync
    replicas to acknowledge the produced messages.
