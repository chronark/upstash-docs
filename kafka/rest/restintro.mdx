title: Introduction

Upstash offers a REST API alongside TCP-based Kafka clients, enabling access to
Kafka topics over HTTP. The REST API is particularly valuable in restricted
environments, such as mobile or edge devices, as it provides a lightweight
alternative to native Kafka clients. By utilizing the REST API, you can
eliminate the need for manual management of Kafka clients and connections. It
offers convenience and simplicity for interacting with Kafka topics without the
complexities associated with native client implementations.

## Get Started

If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow
[these steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.

In the cluster details section of the
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com), scroll down the `REST API`
section. You will see two basic REST API snippets there; the first one is to
produce a message to a topic and the second one is to consume messages from a
topic using Kafka consumer group mechanism.

-   Producer

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/$TOPIC/$MESSAGE \
  -u {{ UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_USERNAME }}:{{ UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_PASSWORD }}
```

-   Consumer

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/consume/$GROUP_NAME/$GROUP_INSTANCE_NAME/$TOPIC \
  -u {{ UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_USERNAME }}:{{ UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_PASSWORD }}
```

Upstash Kafka REST API uses HTTP Basic Authentication scheme. You should copy
the `UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_USERNAME` and `UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_PASSWORD` from the
console and replace then in the code snippets shown above.

## Produce

To produce a message just replace the `$TOPIC` variable with a topic name which
you've created before and replace the `$MESSAGE` with the message you want to
send to the Kafka topic.

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce/mytopic/hello_kafka -u myuser:mypass
```

This will send the message to the `mytopic` Kafka topic and return the metadata
related to the message as a JSON, like:

```json
{
    "topic": "mytopic",
    "partition": 0,
    "offset": 0,
    "timestamp": 1637743323016
}
```

<Note>
    For more info and options about producer API please see [REST Producer
    API](./restproducer) section.
</Note>

## Consume

To consume messages from the topic, replace the `$TOPIC` variable with a topic
name which you've created before, replace the `$GROUP_NAME` with a meaningful
name to be used as the
[Kafka consumer group id](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_group.id),
and `$GROUP_INSTANCE_NAME` with a name for
[Kafka consumer instance id](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_group.instance.id).

```shell
curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/consume/mygroup/mygroup_instance0/mytopic -u myuser:mypass
```

This will consume some messages from the `mytopic` using Kafka consumer group
mechanism and return the messages as a JSON array, like:

```json
[
    {
        "topic": "mytopic",
        "partition": 0,
        "offset": 5,
        "timestamp": 1637745824883,
        "key": "",
        "value": "hello-world",
        "headers": []
    },
    {
        "topic": "mytopic",
        "partition": 0,
        "offset": 6,
        "timestamp": 1637745829327,
        "key": "",
        "value": "hello-kafka",
        "headers": []
    },
    {
        "topic": "mytopic",
        "partition": 0,
        "offset": 7,
        "timestamp": 1637745834756,
        "key": "",
        "value": "hello-upstash",
        "headers": []
    }
]
```

<Note>
    For more info and options about consumer API please see [REST Consumer
    APIs](./restconsumer) section.
</Note>
## Responses

Each API returns a JSON response and they have their own specific structures.
When the API call fails for a reason (illegal argument, unauthorized access,
invalid API etc), a common error JSON message returned. Its structure is as
following:

```typescript
{error: String, status: Int}
```

`error` field contains the error message which explains the cause and `status`
field shows the HTTP status code for the error.

## Next

Apart from the basic usages explained in this section, there are three
categories for the REST API:

-   [Producer API](./restproducer)

-   [Consumer APIs](./restconsumer)

-   [Metadata APIs](./restmetadata)
