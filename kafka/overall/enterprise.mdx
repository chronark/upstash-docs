<Note>
    All Pro/Enterprise plans have multi-replica. Even if your first cluster is
    single-replica, replication is enabled with the upgrade.
</Note>

<Note>
    Pro/Enterprise plans are per cluster (not per account). You can have
    clusters on different plans in the same account and each is charged
    separately. Pro/Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards
    you can cancel any time.
</Note>

### Pro/Enterprise Plans Network & Storage Costs

In Pro/Enterprise plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
    You can enable VPC Peering to minimize network (data transfer) cost. Contact
    us [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

#### Storage Cost

Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which `$0.25 per GB-month`.

Note that the total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1MB data will total up to 3MB in a multi replica cluster.

#### Network Cost

Network costs (data transfer prices) are as below:

-   Data-in: `$0.1` per GB in.
-   Data-out: `$0.05` per GB out.

<Note>
    The above pricing assumes that the clients and cluster are in the same cloud
    provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
    cloud providers charge us. Contact us
    [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.

The following are special features which we are provided on your request. Please email us to learn about their pricing.

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP Whitelisting**           | You can set the IP addresses which will have access to your database.                                                                                                               |
| **TLS Mutual Authentication** | mTLS ensures two-way authentication where both client and server authenticate each other at the same time in the authentication protocol.                                           |
| **VPC Peering**               | VPC Peering enables you to connect to Upstash from your own VPC using private IP. Cluster and your application can run in the same subnet which also minimizes data transfer costs. |
| **AWS Private Link**          | AWS Private link helps you to access to Upstash Cluster with a private network link inside AWS infrastructure.                                                                      |
| **Encryption at rest**        | Upstash encrypts the block storage where your data is persisted and stored.                                                                                                         |
| **Professional Support**      | Professional Support includes dedicated service desk and Slack/Discord channel with response time SLAs.                                                                             |
