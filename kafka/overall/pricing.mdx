<Info>
    Empty consume messages are free, not included in billing calculations.
</Info>

<Info>
    The above plans are per cluster. When you first create your account without
    entering credit card, your first database will be in Free tier. When you
    enter credit card, your database will be upgraded to pay-as-you-go
    automatically.
</Info>

## Free Tier

Upstash has a free tier with some limitations. Free tier limits **10K messages
per day** and **max 256Mb retention size**. A user can create max 10 partitions
in the Free tier. When you enter your credit card, your cluster will be upgraded
to pay-as-you-go plan and limits will be removed.

You do not need to enter your credit card to use Upstash in Free Tier.

<Tip>
    If you want to try Upstash paid and enterprise plans, we can offer **Free
    Trials**. Email us at support@upstash.com
</Tip>

## Serverless Pricing

Pay-as-you-go pricing model is serverless. You pay for the amount of messages
(Kafka messages) processed by your Kafka cluster. The storage cost is charged
separately. The data transfer is free as long as your usage is under the daily
bandwidth quota.

```text
100.000 messages cost $0.6 for a multi replica cluster.

Request cost of Cluster = Total message count / 100.000 X $0.6

Storage cost of Cluster (monthly) = Average Data Size (in GB) X $0.25

Total Cost = Request Cost + Storage Cost
```

We take daily average of your data size and multiply with 0.25 at the end of the
month. If you have 1 GB data in your cluster through the all month, you pay
$0.25 monthly. If your cluster is empty in the first 29 days of the month and it
expands to 30GB on the last day of the month; then still you pay $0.25 for that
month (30GB / 30day X 0.25).

<Note>
    The total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1MB message data
    will total up to 3MB in a multi replica cluster.
</Note>

### Max Monthly Usage (Price)

Upstash limits your monthly cost for a cluster to a max price in pay-as-you-go
plan. Your single replica cluster can not cost more than $120 monthly ($360 for
multi replica clusters). After your cluster exceeds the max usage cost, your
database will be rate limited.

## Pay-as-you-go Plan Quotas

_Pay as you go_ plan has soft limits which are introduced to ensure the fair use
of resources among our users. Quotas are soft limits. When your cluster reaches
the quota we do not stop your service, but we will contact you and ask you to
upgrade your service to an upper plan.

<Note>
    Quotas are not technical limits. They can be customized on your request.
    Contact us (support@upstash.com) if you think your application needs higher
    limits.
</Note>

| Limit                   | Value | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Max Messages Per Second | 1000  | This is the number of messages that you can produce/consume per second. |
| Max Message Size        | 1 MB  | This is the max size of a single message you can produce.               |
| Max Partitions          | 100   | This is the max total number of partitions you can create in the plan.  |
| Max Daily Bandwidth     | 50 GB | The max data transfer (bandwidth) limit per day.                        |

All limits are per cluster. If you think, your use case will exceed the above
quotas, contact us (support@upstash.com) to update the quotas or check our
[Pro/Enterprise Plans](#pro-enterprise-plans) where the limits are higher.

<Note>
    Topics which are idle (no message is produced or consumed) for more than 1.5
    times max-retention-time will be deleted automatically.
</Note>

<Info>
    Should your cluster surpass the daily bandwidth limit, we will notify you
    and suggest considering an upgrade to one of our higher-tier plans. Failure
    to upgrade will result in your cluster incurring a fee of $0.1 per GB for
    the bandwidth usage.
</Info>

## Pro/Enterprise Plans

Upstash has three plans for customers with advanced needs. Different from
pay-as-you-go plan, Pro/Enterprise plans have fixed monthly prices.

| Plan Limit                |   Pro 2K |  Pro 10K |                               Enterprise |
| ------------------------- | -------: | -------: | ---------------------------------------: |
| Max Messages Per Second   |       2K |      10K |                                   Custom |
| Max Message Size          |     10MB |     10MB |                                   Custom |
| Max Partitions            |     1000 |     5000 |                                   Custom |
| Max Retention Size        | infinite | infinite |                                 infinite |
| Max Retention Time        | infinite | infinite |                                 infinite |
| Max Daily Bandwidth       |      1TB | infinite |                                 infinite |
| Monthly Price Per Cluster |     $320 |     $520 | [Contact us](mailto:support@upstash.com) |

<Note>
    All Pro/Enterprise plans have multiple replicas for high availability. Even
    if your first cluster is single-replica, replication is enabled with the
    upgrade.
</Note>

<Note>
    Pro/Enterprise plans are per cluster (not per account). You can have
    clusters on different plans in the same account and each is charged
    separately. Pro/Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards
    you can cancel any time.
</Note>

### How to Upgrade

Apply for an Pro/Enterprise plan in your cluster details page in the console.
Contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) if you have custom
needs or questions.

### Pro/Enterprise Plans Network & Storage Costs

In Pro/Enterprise plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for
storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
    You can enable VPC Peering to minimize network (data transfer) cost. Contact
    us [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

#### Storage Cost

Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which
`$0.25 per GB-month`.

Note that the total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1MB data
will total up to 3MB in a multi replica cluster.

#### Network Cost

Network costs (data transfer prices) are as below:

-   Data-in: `$0.1` per GB in.
-   Data-out: `$0.05` per GB out.

<Note>
    The above pricing assumes that the clients and cluster are in the same cloud
    provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
    cloud providers charge us. Contact us
    [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

### Pro/Enterprise Addons

| **VPC Peering**               | VPC Peering enables you to connect to Upstash from your own VPC using private IP. Cluster and your application can run in the same subnet which also minimizes data transfer costs. |
| **AWS Private Link**          | AWS Private link helps you to access to Upstash Cluster with a private network link inside AWS infrastructure.                                                                      |
| **Encryption at rest**        | Upstash encrypts the block storage where your data is persisted and stored.                                                                                                         |
| **Professional Support**      | Professional Support includes dedicated service desk and Slack/Discord channel with response time SLAs.                                                                             |
