When you create a Kafka cluster on the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com), a _default_ user credentials is
created automatically. _Default_ user credentials has _full access_ rights to the Kafka cluster,
which can produce to & consume from any topic.

You can create additional credentials which can have limited access to topics. Credentials can be limited to _produce-only_
or _consume-only_ and also for a certain topic or a topic prefix. When a topic prefix is used, a user will have access to
any topic whose name starts with the prefix. Newly created credentials can be used with both Kafka clients
and Upstash REST API similar to the _default_ credentials.

To create new credentials, switch to **Credentials** tab in the cluster details page, and click the "New Credentials" button.

There are three inputs in the "New Credentials" view:

-   **Name**: Name of the credentials. This name is shown on the Console only to identify the credentials.
-   **Topic**: A specific topic name or a topic prefix. This can be a literal topic name (such as `users.events`, `product-orders`),
    or a topic prefix (such as `users.*`, `products-*`). Wildcard character `*` can only be used at the end of the topic name.
    `*` means any topic.
-   **Permissions**: Access permissions for the credentials. It has three options: `Full Access`, `Produce Only` and `Consume Only`.

You can see all existing credentials, copy username & password by clicking "+" button and delete a credentials
inside the "Credentials" tab.

Additionally you can change the credentials shown on the console and used in the code snippets
by clicking "Credentials" box at the top right on the Console and selecting one of the credentials.
