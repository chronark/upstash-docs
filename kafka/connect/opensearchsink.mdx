Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector allows you to continuously store the data from your Kafka Topics in any OpenSearch compatible product like Amazon OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, etc.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating an Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector with Elasticsearch.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Prepare the Elasticsearch Environment

If you already have an Elasticsearch environment with the following information, skip this step and continue from the [Create The Connector](#create-the-connector) section.

-   `connection.url`
-   `connection.username`
-   `connection.password`

Go to [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments)
Create or a deployment. Aside from the name,
default configurations should be fine for
this guide.

<Frame>

        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Don't forget to save the deployment credentials.
We need them to create the connector later.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/elasticsearch/2credentials.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Lastly, we need the connection endpoint. Click on your deployment to see the details and click to
the "Copy Endpoint" of Elasticsearch in Applications
section.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/elasticsearch/3endpoint.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

These three(username, password, and endpoint) should be enough to create the connector.

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the `New Connector` button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/img/kafka/connect/connector.png" class="ss" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Choose your connector as `Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector`

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/sink/1connector.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Enter the required properties.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/sink/2config.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the `Connect` button directly.

    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/sink/3advanced.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Congratulations! You have created an OpenSearch Sink Connector.

As you put data into your selected topics, the data will be written into ElasticSearch.
