Debezium Mysql Source Connector allows you to capture any changes on your Mysql DB and store them as messages on your Kafka topics.
In this guide, we will walk you through creating Debezium Mysql Source Connector.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the `New Connector` button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/img/kafka/connect/connector.png" class="ss" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Choose your connector as `Debezium Mysql Connector` for this example

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/debezium/mysql/1connector.png"
        
    />
</Frame>

Enter the required properties.

<Frame>
    <img

    />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the `Connect` button directly.

    />
</Frame>

Congratulations! You have created a Debezium Mysql Source Connector.
As you put data into your Mysql DB, you will see that topics prefixed with given `Server Name`
will be created and populated with new data.

You can go to `Messages` section to see latest events as they are coming from Kafka.
