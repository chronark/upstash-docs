Aiven Http Sink Connector calls a given http endpoint for each item published to your Kafka Topics.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating an Aiven Http Sink Connector.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Prepare the Test Environment

If you already have a http endpoint that you will call you skip this step and continue from the [Create The Connector](#create-the-connector) section.

We will use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to verify if the connector is working.
Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) and copy the unique url to pass it in the connector config later.

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New Connector** button.

Choose your connector as **Aiven Http Sink Connector**

        class="ss"
        width="520"

Enter the required properties.

        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button directly.

Congratulations! You have created an Aiven Http Sink Connector.

As you put data into your selected topics, the requests should be visible in [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
