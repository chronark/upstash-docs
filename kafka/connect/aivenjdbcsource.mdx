Aiven JDBC Source Connector allows you to capture any changes in your SQL dialect relational databases and store them as messages on your Kafka topics.
In this guide, we will walk you through creating the Aiven JDBC Source Connector.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New Connector** button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/img/kafka/connect/connector.png" class="ss" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Choose your connector as **Aiven JDBC Connector Source**

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/jdbc/source/1connector.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Enter the required properties.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/jdbc/source/2config.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button directly.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/jdbc/source/3advanced.png"
        class="ss"
        width="520"
    />
</Frame>

Congratulations! You have created an Aiven JDBC Source Connector.
As you put data into your relational database, your topics will be created
and populated with new data.

You can go to the **Messages** section to see latest events as they are coming from Kafka.
