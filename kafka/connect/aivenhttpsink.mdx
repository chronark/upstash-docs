title: Aiven Http Sink Connector
---

Aiven Http Sink Connector calls a given http endpoint for each item published to
your Kafka Topics.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating an Aiven Http Sink Connector.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
  If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
  steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Prepare the Test Environment

If you already have a http endpoint that you will call you skip this step and
continue from the [Create The Connector](#create-the-connector) section.

We will use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to verify if the connector is
working. Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) and copy the unique url to
pass it in the connector config later.

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector
supports. At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related
documentation. We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button
directly.

Congratulations! You have created an Aiven Http Sink Connector.

As you put data into your selected topics, the requests should be visible in
[webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
