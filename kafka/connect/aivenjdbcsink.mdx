Aiven JDBC Sink Connector allows you to continuously store the data from your Kafka Topics in any sql dialect
relational database like Mysql,PostgreSql etc.
In this guide, we will walk you through creating an Aiven JDBC Sink Connector.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the `New Connector` button.

</Frame>

Choose your connector as `Aiven JDBC Connector Sink`

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/jdbc/source/1connector.png"
        
    />
</Frame>

Enter the required properties.

<Frame>

    />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the `Connect` button directly.

Congratulations! You have created an Aiven JDBC Sink Connector.

As you put data into your selected topics, the data will be written into your relational database.
