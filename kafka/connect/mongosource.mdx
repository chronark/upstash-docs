title: MongoDB Source Connector


---

MongoDB Source Connector allows you to capture any changes in your MongoDB and store them as messages on your Kafka topics.
In this guide, we will walk you through creating MongoDB Source Connector with MongoDB database to Upstash Kafka.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New Connector** button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/img/kafka/connect/connector.png" class="ss" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Choose **MongoDB Connector Source**

<Frame><img src="/img/kafka/connect/mongo/source/1connector.png"/></Frame>

Enter a connector name and MongoDB URI(connection string).
Other configrations are optional. We will skip them for now.

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.
We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button directly.

Congratulations! You have created your MongoDB Source Connector to Kafka.
Note that no topics will be created until some data is available on the MongoDB database.

You can go to **Messages** section of your topic to see latest events as they are coming from Kafka.
