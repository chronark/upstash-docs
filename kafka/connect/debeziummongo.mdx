title: Debezium MongoDB Source Connector


---

Debezium MongoDB Source Connector allows you to capture any changes in your MongoDB database and store them as messages in your Kafka topics.
In this guide, we will walk you through creating a Debezium MongoDB Source Connector with MongoDB database to Upstash Kafka.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New Connector** button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/img/kafka/connect/connector.png" class="ss" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Choose **Debezium MongoDB Connector**

<Frame><img src="/img/kafka/connect/debezium/mongo/1connector.png"/></Frame>

Enter a connector name and MongoDB URI(connection string).
Other configrations are optional. We will skip them for now.

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector supports.
At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related documentation.

<Warning>
    If your MongoDB database is SSL enabled, don't forget to add
    `"mongodb.ssl.enabled": true` at this step. For example, MongoDB Atlas is
    always SSL enabled.
</Warning>

After that we can continue by clicking **Connect**.

Congratulations! You have created a Debezium MongoDB Source Connector to Kafka.
Note that no topics will be created until some data is available on the MongoDB database.

You can go to **Messages** section of the related topic to see latest events as they are coming from Kafka.
