[Decodable](https://www.decodable.co/product?utm_source=upstash) is a platform
which enables developers to build data pipelines using SQL. It is built on
Apache Flink under the hood to provide a seamless experience, while abstracting
away the underlying complexity. In this post, we will show how to connect an
Upstash Kafka topic to Decodable to streamline messages from Kafka to Decodable.

## Upstash Kafka Setup

Create a Kafka cluster using
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/kafka) or
[Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli) by following
[Getting Started](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka).

## Decodable Setup

Just like Upstash, Decodable is a managed service that means you do not need to
host or provision anything. You can easily register for free and start using it.

After creating your account, click on `Connections` and `New Connection`. Select
`Apache Kafka`. Then:

- Select Source as connection type.
- Select **SASL_SSL** as security protocol and **SCRAM-SHA-256** as SASL
  mechanism.
- Enter your topic, SASL username, SASL password. You can find all those from
  Upstash console.
- Value format should be JSON.

In the next step, click on `New Stream` and give a name to it.

In the schema screen, add `country`, `city`, `region` and `url` with `string`
type.

Give a name to your connection and click `Create Connection`. In the next screen
click on Start.

## Test the Setup

Now, let's some events to our Kafka topic. Go to Upstash console, click on your
cluster then `Topics`, click `mytopic`. Select `Messages` tab then click
`Produce a new message`. Send a message in JSON format like the below:

```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "city": "San Jose",
  "region": "CA",
  "url": "https://upstash.com"
}
```

Now, go back to Decodable console, click Streams and select the one you have
created. Then click `Run Preview`. You should see something like:
