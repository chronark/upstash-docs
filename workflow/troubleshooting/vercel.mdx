# Common Issues and Solutions

### Preview Deployment Protection

**Problem:**
When Deployment Protection setting is enabled on Vercel, it's not possible to trigger and complete a workflow run on a preview deployment.

**Solution:**
Vercel provides a way to bypass this protection by using a bypass secret. To create one, follow these steps:

<Steps>
	<Step title="Settings">Go to **Deployment Protection** section under your Vercel project settings.</Step>

	<Step title="Find related section">
		Click on **Add Secret** under **Protection Bypass for Automation** section.
		<Frame>
  			<img src="/img/workflow/troubleshooting/vercel-deployment-protection.png" />
		</Frame>
	</Step>

	<Step title="Generate a bypass token">Don't forget to save it.</Step>
</Steps>

Now that you have a bypass token, you can add it to your workflow URL as a query parameter. Here's an example:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  '<WORKFLOW_URL>/path?x-vercel-protection-bypass=<PROTECTION_BYPASS_SECRET>' \
  -d 'Hello world!'
```
