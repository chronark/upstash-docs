This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Next.js. You can also explore our [Next.js example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/nextjs) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Installation

<Note>
In October 2024, we released a new SDK, `@upstash/workflow`, for Upstash Workflow. If you were using `@upstash/qstash` for Upstash Workflow, you can refer to [the migration guide](/workflow/migration) for the transition.
</Note>
                   

First, install the Workflow SDK in your Next.js project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .env.local
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token:

```bash .env.local
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

<Note>
  This quickstart uses QStash production credentials for simplicity. However, we recommend using our local development server for development and testing once you're familiar with the basics.
  
  Our [local development guide](/workflow/howto/local-development) provides complete setup instructions for creating a sandboxed development environment.
</Note>

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint in a Next.js project, navigate into the Next.js `app/api` directory and create a new folder, for example called `workflow`. Inside this folder, create a `route.ts` file that contains your workflow:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Minimal example">
```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs"

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("initial-step", () => {
      console.log("initial step ran")
    })

    await context.run("second-step", () => {
      console.log("second step ran")
    })
  }
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="With request object">
```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
  // do something with the native request object
  const { POST: handler } = serve(async (context) => {
    // Your workflow steps
  });

  return await handler(request);
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Minimal example (Pages Router)">
```typescript src/pages/api/workflow.ts
import { servePagesRouter } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

const { handler } = servePagesRouter<string>(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("initial-step", () => {
      console.log("initial step ran")
    })

    await context.run("second-step", () => {
      console.log("second step ran")
    })
  }
)
export default handler;
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="With request object (Pages Router)">
```typescript src/pages/api/workflow.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { servePagesRouter } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  // do something with the native request object
  const { handler } = servePagesRouter(
    async (context) => {
      // Your workflow steps
    }
  )

  await handler(req, res)
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. Here's how to [set up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).

Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:

### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)

Set your publically accessible URL as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:

```bash .env.local
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```

### Using the `baseUrl` option

As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App Router">
```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs"

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    // no /api/workflow, just the base URL
    baseUrl: "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/",
  }
)
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Pages Router">
```typescript src/pages/api/workflow.ts
import { servePagesRouter } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

const { handler } servePagesRouter<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    // no /api/workflow, just the base URL
    baseUrl: "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/",
  }
)
export default handler;
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Triggering the workflow

After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by first starting your Next.js app:

```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```

and then making a POST request to your workflow endpoint. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/api/workflow

# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```

See the [documentation on starting a workflow](/workflow/howto/start) for other ways you can start your workflow.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/nextjs_local_request.png" />
</Frame>

Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.

## Step 5: Deploying to Production

When deploying your Next.js application with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN` and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.

2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production:

   <Tabs>
   <Tab title="App Router">
   ```typescript app/api/workflow/route.ts
   import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

   export const { POST } = serve(
     async (context) => {
       // Your workflow steps
     },
     {
       // Conditionally set in development, but not in production
       baseUrl:
         process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
           ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
           : undefined,
     }
   )
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Pages Router">
   ```typescript src/pages/api/workflow.ts
   import { servePagesRouter } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
 
   const { handler } = servePagesRouter<string>(
     async (context) => {
       // Your workflow steps
     },
     {
       // Conditionally set in development, but not in production
       baseUrl:
         process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
           ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
           : undefined,
     }
   )
   export default handler;
   ```
   </Tab>
   </Tabs>

3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel, AWS Amplify or other platforms as you normally would. These platforms will automatically detect and build your Next.js application.

4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:

   ```bash Terminal
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/api/workflow
   ```

5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.

6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
