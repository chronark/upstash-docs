<Update label="December 2024">  
- **TypeScript SDK (`workflow-js`):**  
    - Introduced third-party integrations, starting with Anthropic, Resend, and OpenAI. These integrations are automatically offloaded to workflows, ensuring long-running calls do not consume user environment time. See the related documentation [here](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/basics/context#context-api).  
    - Added a `timeout` parameter to `context.call`. Learn more in the [documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/basics/context#context-call).  
    - Improved support for workflows in Express and SvelteKit by adding the `useJSONContent` option.  
    - Resolved loop detection issues on Cloudflare and Render.  
    - Full changelog, including all fixes, is available [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.4).  

- **Workflow Server:**  
    - Added the `WorkflowCreatedAt` filter for Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and Events.  
    - Prepared the local development server for public release (coming soon).  
    - Enhanced `context.SleepUntil` to support float values.  
    - Increased the event retention period from 10,000 events to up to 14 days. Learn more on the [Pricing page](https://upstash.com/pricing/qstash).
