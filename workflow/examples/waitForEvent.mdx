## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to handle order processing using Upstash Workflow. The workflow waits for an external system to process an order and resumes once it is 'notified'.

## Use Case

Our workflow will:

1. Receive an order request.
2. Wait for an external event that indicates the order has been processed.
3. Process the order upon receiving the event.
4. Send a confirmation email to the user.
5. Handle timeout scenarios if the event is not received in time.
6. Demonstrate how to notify the workflow.

## Code Example

```typescript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  const { orderId, userEmail } = context.requestPayload;

  // Step 1: Wait for the order to be processed
  const { eventData, timeout } = await context.waitForEvent(
    "wait for order processing",
    `order-${orderId}`,
    600 // 10 minutes timeout
  );

  if (timeout) {
    // end workflow in case of timeout
    return;
  }

  const processedData = eventData;

  // Step 2: Log the processed order
  await context.run("process-order", async () => {
    console.log(`Order ${orderId} processed:`, processedData);
  });

  // Step 3: Send a confirmation email
  await context.run("send-confirmation-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(
      userEmail,
      "Your order has been processed!",
      processedData
    );
  });
});
```

Code for notifying the worklfow:

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const orderId = "1324"

await client.notify({
  eventId: `order-${orderId}`,
  eventData: { deliveryTime: "2 days" }
});
```

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Waiting for the Event

The workflow first waits for the order to be processed. It uses [the `waitForEvent` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent) to pause execution and listen for the event. A timeout of 10 minutes (600 seconds) is applied to avoid indefinite waiting.

```typescript
const { eventData, timeout } = await context.waitForEvent(
  "wait for order processing",
  `order-${orderId}`,
  600 // 10 minutes timeout
);

if (timeout) {
  // end workflow in case of timeout
  return;
}
```

The workflow listens for the event with the ID `order-${orderId}`. When the external service notifies the workflow with this ID, the workflow resumes. If no event is received in time, the timeout block ensures the workflow doesn't hang.

### 2. Processing the Order

Once the workflow resumes, the order data (`eventData`) is logged and processed. This step could include updates to the database, inventory adjustments, or other backend operations specific to order processing.

```typescript
await context.run("process-order", async () => {
  console.log(`Order ${orderId} processed:`, processedData);
});
```

### 3. Sending a Confirmation Email

Once the order is processed, the workflow sends a confirmation email to the user.

```typescript
await context.run("send-confirmation-email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    userEmail,
    "Your order has been processed!",
    processedData
  );
});
```

## External Event Notification

To notify the workflow that the order has been processed, the external system sends a notification to the workflow with relevant data using the [`notify` method from the `Client`](/workflow/basics/client#notify-waiting-workflow). Alternatively, you can use [`context.notify` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-notify).

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const orderId = "1324";

await client.notify({
  eventId: `order-${orderId}`,
  eventData: { deliveryTime: "2 days" }
});
```

## Key Features

1. **Asynchronous Event Handling**: The workflow waits for an external event (order processing) to occur and only resumes once the event is received.
2. **Timeout Control**: A timeout mechanism ensures that the workflow doesn't hang if the event isn't received within the expected time.
3. **Order Processing**: Once notified, the workflow handles order processing and sends a confirmation email to the customer.
4. **External Event Notifications**: The external system can notify the workflow, providing the necessary data to resume execution and complete the process.
