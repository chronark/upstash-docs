<Info>
  The above plans are per database. When you first create your account without
  entering credit card, your first database will be in Free tier. When you enter
  credit card, your database will be upgraded to pay-as-you-go automatically.
  You need to contact us to upgrade a database to a pro/enterprise plan.
</Info>

<Info>
  For Global databases, the write commands are replicated to all read regions in
  addition to primary region. Replications (write operations) are counted as
  commands. For example, if you have 1 primary 1 read region, 100K writes will
  cost $0.8 ($0.4 x 2)
</Info>

## Free Tier

Upstash has a free tier with some limitations. Free tier limits **10K commands
per day** and **total 256Mb data size** . You can create one read region at
maximum in the free tier. A user can create only one database in Free tier. When
you enter your credit card, your database will be upgraded to the pay-as-you-go
plan and limits will be removed.

You do not need to enter your credit card to use Upstash in Free Tier.

## Serverless Pricing

Pay-as-you-go pricing model is serverless. You pay for the amount of commands (
Redis commands) processed by your database. Persistence is enabled by default,
the storage cost is charged separately. The data transfer is free as long as
your usage is under the daily bandwidth quota.

```text
100K commands cost 0.2 USD.

Request cost of a Database = Total command count / 100K X $0.2

Storage cost of Database (monthly) = Average Data Size (in GB) X $0.25

Total Cost = Request Cost + Storage Cost
```

<Note>
  Operational commands like AUTH, INFO, PING, QUIT, COMMAND are not charged.
</Note>

Even if you do not access your data, we have to keep it persistent in Cloud
Provider's block storage (eg AWS EBS, S3) for durability. We take daily average
of your data size and multiply with 0.25 at the end of the month. If you have 1
GB data in your database through the all month, you pay $0.25 monthly. If your
database is empty in the first 29 days of the month and it expands to 6GB on the
last day of the month; then you pay $0.05 for that month (6GB / 30day X 0.25).

If you are using your database as a cache; then it is a good practice to set a
timeout (EXPIRE) for your keys to minimize the cost.

<Note>
  The total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1 MB data will
  total up to 2 MB because data is replicated to multiple instances.
</Note>

### Max Monthly Usage (Price)

Upstash limits your monthly cost for a database to a max price in pay-as-you-go
plan. Your database can not cost more than $160 monthly. After your database
exceeds the max usage cost, your database will be rate limited.

## Pay-as-you-go Plan Quotas

_Pay as you go_ plan has limits which are introduced to ensure the fair use of
resources among our users. When your database reaches the quota we do not stop
your service but we will contact you and ask you to upgrade your service to an
upper plan.

<Note>
  Quotas are not technical limits. They can be customized on your request. You
  can submit contact us (support@upstash.com) if you think your application
  needs higher limits.
</Note>

| Limit                             | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Max Request Size                  | 1Mb    | The max size of a single request/command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Max Record Size                   | 100 Mb | This is the maximum size per your entry. The entry can be String, List, Set, Hash etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Max Data Size Per DB              | 10Gb   | When limit is reached, if [eviction](../features/eviction) is enabled, some entries will be evicted to allow new writes. Otherwise, write commands will be rejected.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Max Concurrent Connections Per DB | 1000   | When the limit is reached, your idle connections may be terminated. You will not experience any issue unless all of your connections are active. Even in that case; most Redis clients reconnect automatically. You can use [REST API](../features/restapi) if you expect very high number of concurrent connections. |
| Max Memory Storage Per DB         | 1GB    | Upstash stores entries in both memory and SSD. Once the memory size reaches its limit, entries are evicted from memory. However, when an evicted entry is accessed, it is reloaded from SSD back into memory.                                                                                                         |
| Max Daily Bandwidth               | 50GB   | The max outbound data transfer (bandwidth) limit per day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The specified limits apply to each individual database. If you anticipate that
your use case will surpass the aforementioned quotas, we recommend exploring our
Pro/Enterprise Plans, which offer higher limits. You can find more information
about these plans by visiting the [Enterprise Plan](#enterprise-plan) section.

<Info>
  Should your database surpass the daily bandwidth limit, we will notify you and
  suggest considering an upgrade to one of our higher-tier plans. Failure to
  upgrade will result in your database incurring a fee of $0.1 per GB for the
  bandwidth usage.
</Info>

## Custom Quotas

You can customize some quotas for your database in the pay-as-you-go plan with
an extra fee. Here the pricing for them:

| Max Request Size Limit | Extra Price |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| 10MB                   | $50.00      |
| 50MB                   | $80.00      |
| 100MB                  | $120.00     |

| Max Record Size Limit | Extra Price (monthly) |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 256MB                 | $60.00                |
| 500MB                 | $100.00               |
| 1GB                   | $180.00               |

If you need to change other limits (max commands per sec, max data size etc),
