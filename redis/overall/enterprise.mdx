  databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged
  separately. Pro/Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards
  you can cancel any time.

### Pro/Enterprise Plans Network & Storage Costs

In Pro/Enterprise plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for
storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
  You can enable VPC Peering to minimize data transfer cost. Contact us
  [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>
#### Storage Cost Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which
`$0.25 per GB-month`. The total cost is determined by adding up the storage at all
replica and regions.

#### Network Cost

Network (data transfer) cost is `$0.03 per GB` for regional databases. For
Global databases the cost is `$0.1 per GB`. For use cases with high volume, you
may consider VPC Peering which minimizes the data transfer cost.

<Note>
  The above pricing assumes that the clients and database are in the same cloud
  provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
  cloud providers charge us. Contact us
  [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

### Pro/Enterprise Addons

The following are special features which we are provided on your request with an
extra fee. Please contact us to learn about their pricing.
