You can create a manual backup of your database and restore that backup to any
of your databases. Both backup and restore operations requires that your
database is in one of the AWS regions.

Additionally, you can utilize the daily backup feature to automatically create
backups of your database on a daily basis.

note that your database will be temporarily locked, which means these operations
will be unavailable during this time:

- Enable TLS
- Move Database to Team
- Restore Database Backup
