You can create a manual backup of your database and restore that backup to any of your databases. Both backup and restore operations requires that your database is in one of the AWS regions.

Additionally, you can utilize the daily backup feature to automatically create backups of your database on a daily basis.

### Create A Manual Backup

During the process of creating a backup for your database, it is important to note that your database will be temporarily locked, which means these operations will be unavailable during this time:

-   Create Database Backup
-   Enable TLS
-   Move Database to Team
-   Restore Database Backup
-   Update Eviction
-   Update Password
-   Delete Database
