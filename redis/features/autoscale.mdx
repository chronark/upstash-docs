title: Auto Scale
---

You can enable auto scaling for your database. When your database reaches the
quotas of your current plan, it will automatically be upgraded to a higher plan
without requiring your confirmation. These upgrades are performed seamlessly,
without causing any downtime. Upon completion of the upgrade, you will receive
an informative email notification.

Upgrades are triggered when one of the below quotas is exceeded multiple times
in a predefined period.

- Max Commands Per Second
- Max Concurrent Connections
- Max Data Size
- Max Daily Bandwidth
- Max Memory Storage
- Max Monthly Usage Cap

You can enable auto scale while creating your database or from the database
details page for an existing database.
