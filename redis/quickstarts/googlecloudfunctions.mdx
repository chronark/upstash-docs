<Note>
  This tutorial uses [@upstash/redis](/oss/sdks/ts/redis/overview) which is
  designed for serverless runtimes for efficient connection handling. You can
  use your favorite Redis client, but you may have to deal with connection
  issues as described
  [here](https://upstash.com/blog/serverless-database-connections).
</Note>
### Database Setup

Create a Redis database using [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or
[Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli). Select the GCP US-Central-1 as
the region. Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for
the next steps.

### Project Setup

Create a folder for your project, run `npm init` inside. Then install Upstash
client with: `npm install @upstash/redis`

### The Code

Update `index.js` as below:

```js
const { Redis } = require("@upstash/redis/with-fetch");

const redis = new Redis({
    url: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL",
    token: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN",
});

exports.helloCounter = async (req, res) => {
    let count = await redis.incr("counter");
    res.send("Page view:" + count);
};
```

## Run and Deploy

Deploy your function to Google Cloud with:

```shell
gcloud functions deploy helloCounter \
--runtime nodejs16 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
```

You will see the URL of your Cloud Function. Click to the URL to check if it is
working properly.

```shell
httpsTrigger:
  securityLevel: SECURE_OPTIONAL
  url: https://us-central1-functions-317005.cloudfunctions.net/helloCounter
```

In case of an issue, you can check the logs of your Cloud Function in the GCP
console as below.
