:::info
Upstash has native integration with [DigitalOcean Add-On Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/upstash-redis).

This quickstart shows how to create an Upstash for Redis® Database from DigitalOcean Add-On Marketplace.

### Database Setup

Creating Upstash for Redis Database requires a DigitalOcean account.

[Login or Sign-up](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) for DigitalOcean account. Then navigate the [Upstash Redis Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/upstash-redis) page.

Click `Add Upstash Redis` button. Now setup page will open and it will ask `Database Name / Plan / Region` info.

After selecting Name, Plan and Region, click `Add Upstash Redis` button.

### Connecting to Database - SSO

After creating database, Overview/Details page will be opened.

Environment variables can be shown in that page.

While creating a Droplet, Upstash Addon can be selected and environment variables are automatically injected to Droplet.

These Steps can be followed: `Create --> Droplets --> Marketplace Add-Ons` then select the previously created Upstash Redis Addon.

Upstash also support Single Sign-On from DigitalOcean to Upstash Console.

So databases created from DigitalOcean can benefit from Upstash Console features.

In order to access Upstash Console from DigitalOcean just click `Dashboard` link when you create the Upstash addon.
