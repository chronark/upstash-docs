title: "AWS Lambda Rate Limiting with Serverless Redis"

description: "This tutorial shows how to limit rate in AWS Lambda with Serverless Redis."
---

UPDATE: We have developed
[Upstash Rate Limiting SDK](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit). We recommend
it with Upstash Redis.

In this tutorial, we will throttle AWS Lambda functions using Serverless Redis
based on the client's IP address.

See
[code](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/master/serverless-rate-limiting).

See [demo](https://5hg3vtj7gk.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hello).

### `1` Serverless Project Setup

If you do not have it already, install serverless framework via:
`npm install -g serverless`

In any folder run `serverless` as below:

```text
>> serverless

Serverless: No project detected. Do you want to create a new one? Yes
Serverless: What do you want to make? AWS Node.js
Serverless: What do you want to call this project? serverless-rate-limiting

Project successfully created in 'serverless-rate-limiting' folder.

You can monitor, troubleshoot, and test your new service with a free Serverless account.

Serverless: Would you like to enable this? No
You can run the “serverless” command again if you change your mind later.
```

<Note>
See [Using AWS SAM](/redis/tutorials/using_aws_sam), if you prefer AWS SAM over Serverless Framework.
</Note>

Inside the project folder create a node project with the command:

```
npm init
```

Then install the redis client and rate limiting libraries with:

```
npm install ioredis async-ratelimiter request-ip
```

Update the `serverless.yml` as below. Copy your Redis URL from console and
replace below:

```yaml
service: serverless-rate-limiting
frameworkVersion: "2"
provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: nodejs12.x
    lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221
functions:
    hello:
        handler: handler.hello
        events:
            - httpApi:
                  path: /hello
                  method: get
```

<Note>
    For the best performance choose the same region for your Lambda function and
    Upstash database.
</Note>

### `2` Create a Redis (Upstash) Database

Create a database from [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com)

### `3` Code

Edit handler.js and replace your REDIS_URL below.

<Snippet file="redis/ioredisnote.mdx" />

```javascript
const RateLimiter = require("async-ratelimiter");
const Redis = require("ioredis");
const { getClientIp } = require("request-ip");

const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
    db: new Redis("YOUR_REDIS_URL"),
    max: 1,
    duration: 5_000,
});

module.exports.hello = async (event) => {
    const clientIp = getClientIp(event) || "NA";
    const limit = await rateLimiter.get({ id: clientIp });
    if (!limit.remaining) {
        return {
            statusCode: 429,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                message: "Sorry, you are rate limited. Wait for 5 seconds",
            }),
        };
    }

    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({
            message: "hello!",
        }),
    };
};
```

Above, we have configured the rate limiting to accept 1 request from the same IP
address in 5 seconds.

### `4` Deploy and Try the API

Deploy your functions with:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The command will deploy the function and show the endpoint url. Click to the
endpoint url. If you refresh your page, you will see that your request is
throttled.
