title: Serverless Redis on Google Cloud Functions
---

Google Cloud Functions is the second most popular serverless execution platform.
Similar to AWS Lambda it is stateless, namely you need to access external
resources to read or write your applications state. In this post, we will
introduce Redis as a database for your Google Cloud functions.

This tutorial shows how to build a serverless API with Redis on Google Cloud
Functions. The API will simply count the page views and show it in JSON format.
