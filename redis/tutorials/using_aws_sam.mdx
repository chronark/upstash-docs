title: Using AWS SAM
---

This tutorial implements a serverless application and deploy it to AWS Lambda using AWS SAM.

:::note
See [Using Serverless Framework](using_serverless_framework.md), if you prefer Serverless Framework over SAM.

### Step 1: Create database on Upstash

If you do not have one, create a database following this [guide](../overall/getstarted.md).

### Step 2: Project Setup

If you do not have it already install AWS SAM as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html)

In any folder run `sam init` and select `Hello World Example` as below:

```shell
➜  serverless-tutorials > ✗ sam init

        SAM CLI now collects telemetry to better understand customer needs.

        You can OPT OUT and disable telemetry collection by setting the
        environment variable SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY=0 in your shell.
        Thanks for your help!

    -----------------------
    Generating application:
    -----------------------
    Name: using-aws-sam
    Runtime: nodejs14.x
    Dependency Manager: npm
    Application Template: hello-world
    Output Directory: .

    Next steps can be found in the README file at ./using-aws-sam/README.md


```

Inside the hello-world folder install the redis client with:

```
npm install ioredis
```

Edit hello-world>app.js file as below. Replace the Redis URL (copy ioredis url from your Upstash console).

```javascript
let response;
var Redis = require("ioredis");

if (typeof client === "undefined") {
    var client = new Redis(REDIS_URL);
}

exports.lambdaHandler = async (event, context) => {
    try {
        console.log("hello");
        await client.set("hello", "world");
        let res = await client.get("hello");
        response = {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                message: "hello " + res,
                // location: ret.data.trim()
            }),
        };
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return err;
    }

    return response;
};
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your Function

In the project folder run:

```
sam build
```

The output will be:

```shell
➜  using-aws-sam git:(master) ✗ sam build
Building codeuri: /Users/enes/dev/serverless-tutorials/using-aws-sam/hello-world runtime: nodejs14.x metadata: {} functions: ['HelloWorldFunction']
Running NodejsNpmBuilder:NpmPack
Running NodejsNpmBuilder:CopyNpmrc
Running NodejsNpmBuilder:CopySource
Running NodejsNpmBuilder:NpmInstall
Running NodejsNpmBuilder:CleanUpNpmrc

Build Succeeded

Built Artifacts  : .aws-sam/build
Built Template   : .aws-sam/build/template.yaml

Commands you can use next
=========================
[*] Invoke Function: sam local invoke
[*] Deploy: sam deploy --guided


```

Deploy your function via `sam deploy --guided`.

You can run your function locally with `sam local invoke`

You can also test your function using AWS console. In your AWS Lambda section, click on your function. Scroll down to the code sections and click on the `Test` button on the top right.

    <img src="/img/awslambda/success3.png" width="800" />
</Frame>

Congratulations, now your lambda function inserts entry to your Upstash database.

### What can be the next?

-   You can write and deploy another function to just get values from the database.
-   You can integrate [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html) so you can call your function via http.
-   You can learn about how to monitor your functions from CloudWatch as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg//monitoring-functions-logs.html).

#### Redis Connections in AWS Lambda

Although Redis connections are very lightweight, a new connection inside each Lambda function can cause a notable latency. On the other hand, reusing Redis connections inside the AWS Lambda functions has its own drawbacks. When AWS scales out Lambda functions, the number of open connections can rapidly increase. Fortunately, Upstash detects and terminates the idle and zombie connections thanks to its smart connection handling algorithm. Thanks to this algorithm; we have been recommending caching your Redis connection in serverless functions.
