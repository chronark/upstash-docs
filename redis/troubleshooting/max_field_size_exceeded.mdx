title: ERR max field size exceeded
---

### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR max field size exceeded. Limit: X bytes, Actual: Z bytes 
```

### Diagnosis
Size of a HASH field in the request exceeds the max field size limit, which is `32Kb`.

### Solution
This is a hardcoded limit and cannot be configured per database. You should reduce the field sizes in HASH entries.
