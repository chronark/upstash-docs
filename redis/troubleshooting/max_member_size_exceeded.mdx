title: ERR max member size exceeded
---

### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR max member size exceeded. Limit: X bytes, Actual: Z bytes 
```

### Diagnosis
Size of a SET or ZSET member in the request exceeds the max member size limit, which is `32Kb`.

### Solution
This is a hardcoded limit and cannot be configured per database. You should reduce the member sizes in SET and ZSET entries.
