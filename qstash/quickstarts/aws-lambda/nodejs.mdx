This is a step by step guide on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your
Lambda function on AWS.

### 1. Create a new project

Let's create a new folder called `aws-lambda` and initialize a new project with
your favourite package manager. This example uses `npm` because everyone will
have it installed with node already.

```bash
mkdir aws-lambda
cd aws-lambda
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using typescript requires installing a few dependencies. Here we are using
`esbuild` to bundle our code, so we can upload it to AWS later.

```bash
npm install -D @types/aws-lambda @types/node esbuild
```

### 3. Creating the handler function

In this example we will show how to receive a webhook from QStash and verify the
signature without any additional dependencies.

First, let's import everything we need:

```ts
import type {
  APIGatewayEvent,
  APIGatewayProxyResult,
  Context,
} from "aws-lambda";
import { createHash, createHmac } from "node:crypto";
```

As you can see, we only need the type definitions from AWS and some crypto
functions from the node standard library.

Next we create the handler function. Ignore the `verify` function for now. We
will add that next. In the handler we will prepare all necessary variables that
we need for verification. This includes the signature, the signing keys and the
url of the lambda function. Then we try to verify the request using the current
signing key and if that fails we will try the next one. If the signature could
be verified, we can start processing the request.

```ts
export const handler = async (
  event: APIGatewayEvent,
  context: Context
): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  const signature = event.headers["upstash-signature"]!;
  const currentSigningKey = process.env["QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY"];
  const nextSigningKey = process.env["QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY"];
  const url = `https://${event.requestContext.domainName}`;

  try {
    // Try to verify the signature with the current signing key and if that fails, try the next signing key
    // This allows you to roll your signing keys once without downtime
    await verify(signature, currentSigningKey, event.body, url).catch((err) => {
      console.error(
        `Failed to verify signature with current signing key: ${err}`
      );
      return verify(signature, nextSigningKey, event.body, url);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      body: err instanceof Error ? err.toString() : err,
    };
  }

  // Add your business logic here

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "OK",
  };
};
```

The `verify` function will handle the actual verification of the signature. The
signature itself is actually a [JWT](https://jwt.io) and includes claims about
the request. See [here](/qstash/features/security#claims).

```ts
/**
 * @param jwt - The content of the `upstash-signature` header
 * @param signingKey - The signing key to use to verify the signature (Get it from Upstash Console)
 * @param body - The raw body of the request
 * @param url - The public URL of the lambda function
 */
async function verify(
  jwt: string,
  signingKey: string,
  body: string | null,
  url: string
): Promise<void> {
  const split = jwt.split(".");
  if (split.length != 3) {
    throw new Error("Invalid JWT");
  }
  const [header, payload, signature] = split;

  if (
    signature !=
    createHmac("sha256", signingKey)
      .update(`${header}.${payload}`)
      .digest("base64url")
  ) {
    throw new Error("Invalid JWT signature");
  }

  // Now the jwt is verified and we can start looking at the claims in the payload
  const p: {
    sub: string;
    iss: string;
    exp: number;
    nbf: number;
    body: string;
  } = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(payload, "base64url").toString());

  if (p.iss !== "Upstash") {
    throw new Error(`invalid issuer: ${p.iss}, expected "Upstash"`);
  }
  if (p.sub !== url) {
    throw new Error(`invalid subject: ${p.sub}, expected "${url}"`);
  }

  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  if (now > p.exp) {
    throw new Error("token has expired");
  }
  if (now < p.nbf) {
    throw new Error("token is not yet valid");
  }

  if (body != null) {
    if (
      p.body.replace(/=+$/, "") !=
      createHash("sha256").update(body).digest("base64url")
    ) {
      throw new Error("body hash does not match");
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the complete file
[here](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/tree/main/aws-lambda/index.ts).

That's it, now we can create the function on AWS and test it.

### 4. Create a Lambda function on AWS

Create a new Lambda function from scratch by going to the
[AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/create/function).
(Make sure you select your desired region)

Give it a name and select `Node.js 16.x` as runtime, then create the function.
![](/img/qstash/aws/create_lambda.png)

Afterwards we will add a public URL to this lambda by going to the
`Configuration` tab:

![](/img/qstash/aws/create_url.png)

Select `Auth Type = NONE` because we are handling authentication ourselves.

After creating the url, you should see it on the right side of the overview of
your function: ![](/img/qstash/aws/overview.png)

### 5. Set Environment Variables

Get your current and next signing key from the
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash)

On the same `Configuration` tab from earlier, we will now set the required
environment variables: ![](/img/qstash/aws/environment.png)

### 6. Deploy your Lambda function

We need to bundle our code and zip it to deploy it to AWS.

Add the following script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf ./dist; esbuild index.ts --bundle --minify --sourcemap --platform=node --target=es2020 --outfile=dist/index.js && cd dist && zip -r index.zip index.js*"
  }
}
```

When calling `npm run build` this will build and zip the code.

Afterwards we can click the `Upload from` button in the lower right corner and
deploy the code to AWS. Select `./dist/index.zip` as upload file.
![](/img/qstash/aws/upload.png)

### 7. Publish a message

Open a different terminal and publish a message to QStash. Note the destination
url is the URL from step 4.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://aacn3pedteibt5gg72xr77wnma0poteq.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure AWS lambda function, that
receives and verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.

## QStash SDK

[Our Typescript Sdk](https://github.com/upstash/sdk-qstash-ts) will handle
verification automatically if you want to use it.

```ts
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";

const r = new Receiver({
  currentSigningKey: process.env["QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY"],
  nextSigningKey: process.env["QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY"],
});

await r.verify({
  signature: event.headers["upstash-signature"],
  body: event.body,
  url: `https://${event.requestContext.domainName}`,
});
```
