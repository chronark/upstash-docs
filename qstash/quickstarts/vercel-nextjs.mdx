[Source Code](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/tree/main/vercel-nextjs)

This is a step by step guide on how to receive webhooks from qstash in your
Next.js app.

### 1. Create a new nextjs app named `qstash-receiver`

There are
[great tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup) on
how to setup Next.js on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), so I won't go into
details here.

```bash
npx create-next-app qstash-receiver
cd qstash-receiver
```

### 2. Install qstash

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```

### 3. Create a new api route /api/qstash

```bash
touch ./api/qstash.js
```

And add the following code:

```js
import { Nextjs } from "@upstash/qstash";

async function handler(req, res) {
  console.log("If this is printed, the signature has already been verified");

  // do stuff
  res.status(200).end();
}

export default Nextjs.verifySignature(handler);

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};
```

`verifySignature` will try to load `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and
`QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the environment. If one of them is missing, an
error is thrown. We will set these in step 5.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

I'm deploying using [Vercel's CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli), but you could
also push your project to a remote repo and deploy that way. If you have never
used the cli, please run `npx vercel login` before.
[See here](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/login)

You can accept all the default settings.

```bash
$ npx vercel

### 5. Set Signing Keys in Vercel

Go to your project's settings and set the following environment variables:

### 6. Redeploy to use the new environment variables

To make the added environment variables take effect, you must redeploy your
project.

```bash
$ npx vercel --prod
Vercel CLI 24.2.5
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/chronark/vercel-nextjs/3wPxyEPwdcMrncSNqFNcDD41rjxB [3s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://vercel-nextjs-two-sandy.vercel.app [copied to clipboard] [39s]
```

### 7. Publish a message

Go to your project's logs and then publish a new message.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://vercel-nextjs-two-sandy.vercel.app/api/qstash" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

```bash
{"messageId":"msg_5GJrFa5aMFxDYsDygAnW9YW8cmRm"}
```

In the logs you should see something like this:

```
[POST] /api/qstash
If this is printed, the signature has already been verified
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure Next.js API route, that
receives and verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.
