title: "Cloudflare Workers"

[Source Code](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/tree/main/cloudflare-workers)

This is a step by step guide on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your
Cloudflare Worker.

This example is written in typescript, because it is the default when creating
new workers with `wrangler v2`.

### 0. Prerequisites

- [wrangler 2.0](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2)
- A cloudflare account

### 1. Create a new wrangler app

```bash
 $ wrangler init cloudflare-workers

 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Using npm as package manager.
‚ú® Created cloudflare-workers/wrangler.toml
No package.json found. Would you like to create one? (y/n)
‚ú® Created cloudflare-workers/package.json
Would you like to use TypeScript? (y/n)
‚ú® Created cloudflare-workers/tsconfig.json
Would you like to create a Worker at cloudflare-workers/src/index.ts?
  None
‚ùØ Fetch handler
  Scheduled handler
‚ú® Created cloudflare-workers/src/index.ts

To start developing your Worker, run `cd cloudflare-workers && npm start`
To publish your Worker to the Internet, run `npm run deploy`
```

Go to the new directory

```
cd cloudflare-workers
```

### 2. Install QStash

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```

### 3. Use QStash in your handler

First we import the library:

```ts
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash/cloudflare";
```

Then we adjust the `Env` interface to include the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`
and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` environment variables.

```ts
export interface Env {
  QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY: string;
  QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY: string;
}
```

And then we validate the signature in the `handler` function.

First we create a new receiver and provide it with the signing keys.

```ts
const receiver = new Receiver({
  currentSigningKey: env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY,
  nextSigningKey: env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY,
});
```

Then we verify the signature.

```ts
const body = await request.text();

const isValid = r.verify({
  signature: request.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
  body,
});
```

The entire file looks like this now:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash/cloudflare";
export interface Env {
  QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY: string;
  QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY: string;
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const c = new Receiver({
      currentSigningKey: env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY,
      nextSigningKey: env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY,
    });

    const body = await request.text();

    const isValid = await c
      .verify({
        signature: request.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
        body,
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
        return false;
      });
    if (!isValid) {
      return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 });
    }
    console.log("The signature was valid");

    // do work here

    return new Response("Hello World!");
  },
};
```

### 4. Add your signing keys to cloudflare

Get your current and next signing key from
[Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and then set them using
`wrangler secret put ...`

```bash
wrangler secret put QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Retrieving cached values for account from node_modules/.cache/wrangler
Enter a secret value: ******************************************************
üåÄ Creating the secret for the Worker "cloudflare-workers"
‚ú® Success! Uploaded secret QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY
‚ûú  cloudflare-workers git:(master) ‚úó wrangler secret put QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Retrieving cached values for account from node_modules/.cache/wrangler
Enter a secret value: ******************************************************
üåÄ Creating the secret for the Worker "cloudflare-workers"
‚ú® Success! Uploaded secret QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY
```

### 5. Deploy your worker

Deploy your worker to cloudflare using `npm run deploy`

```bash
$ npm run deploy

> cloudflare-workers@0.0.0 deploy
> wrangler publish

 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Retrieving cached values for account from node_modules/.cache/wrangler
Total Upload: 6.32 KiB / gzip: 2.01 KiB
Uploaded cloudflare-workers (2.06 sec)
Published cloudflare-workers (1.73 sec)
  cloudflare-workers.upstash.workers.dev
```

You can view the logs from your deployed worker.

```bash
wrangler tail
```

### 6. Publish a message

Open a different terminal and publish a message to QStash. Note the destination
url is the same that was printed in the previous deploy step.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://cloudflare-workers.upstash.workers.dev" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

In the logs you should see something like this:

```bash
$ wrangler tail

‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Retrieving cached values for account from node_modules/.cache/wrangler
Successfully created tail, expires at 2022-07-11T21:11:36Z
Connected to cloudflare-workers, waiting for logs...
POST https://cloudflare-workers.upstash.workers.dev/ - Ok @ 7/11/2022, 5:13:19 PM
  (log) The signature was valid
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure Cloudflare Worker, that
receives and verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.
