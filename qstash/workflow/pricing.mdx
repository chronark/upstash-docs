Upstash Workflow is built on QStash, and the pricing model follows a "pay-as-you-go" approach. You only pay when your app receives traffic, so there's no cost when it's not in use.

Each workflow run consists of multiple QStash messages, with the total cost determined by the number of messages used.

You can track your current message usage and associated costs in the [Overview tab of the console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details).

### Message Usage per Workflow Run

- [context.run](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-run), [context.sleep](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-sleep), or [context.sleepUntil](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-sleepuntil) command generates a single message.
- The [context.call](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-call) command generates two messages.
- If the workflow endpoint or URL in [context.call](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-call) returns an error or is unreachable, the workflow SDK will retry the call (up to 3 times by default). Each retry counts as a new message.
