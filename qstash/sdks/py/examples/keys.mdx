#### Retrieve your signing Keys

```python
from upstash_qstash import Client

client = Client("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
keys = client.keys()
both_keys = keys.get()

print(both_keys["current"], both_keys["next"])
```

#### Rotate your signing Keys

```python
from upstash_qstash import Client

client = Client("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
keys = client.keys()
new_keys = keys.rotate()
print(new_keys["current"], new_keys["next"])
```
