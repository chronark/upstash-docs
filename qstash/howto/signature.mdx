title: "Verify Signatures"
---

We send a JWT with each request. This JWT is signed by your individual secret
signing keys and sent in the `Upstash-Signature` HTTP header.

To verify the jwt you can choose from a
[wide array of open source libraries](https://jwt.io/libraries), or roll your
own solution.

## Claims

All claims in the JWT are listed [here](/qstash/features/security#claims)

## Verifying

The exact implementation depends on the language of your choice and the library
if you use one.

Instead here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Split the JWT into its header, payload and signature
2. Verify the signature
3. Decode the payload and verify the claims
   - `iss`: The issuer must be`Upstash`.
   - `sub`: The subject must the url of your API.
   - `exp`: Verify the token has not expired yet.
   - `nbf`: Verify the token is already valid.
   - `body`: Hash the raw request body using `SHA-256` and compare it with the
     `body` claim.

You can also reference the implementation in our
[typescript sdk](https://github.com/upstash/sdk-qstash-ts/blob/main/src/receiver.ts#L82) or use 
the methods provided in the SDKs:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";

const receiver = new Receiver({
  currentSigningKey: "YOUR_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY",
  nextSigningKey: "YOUR_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY",
});

// ... in your request handler

const signature = req.headers["Upstash-Signature"];
const body = req.body;

const isValid = receiver.verify({
  body,
  signature,
  url: "YOUR-SITE-URL",
});
```

```python Python
from qstash import Receiver

receiver = Receiver(
    current_signing_key="YOUR_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY",
    next_signing_key="YOUR_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY",
)

# ... in your request handler

signature, body = req.headers["Upstash-Signature"], req.body

receiver.verify(
    body=body,
    signature=signature,
    url="YOUR-SITE-URL",
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>In JavaScript, the body could be presented by an object via the HTTP handler if it is a JSON. Don't forget to convert to string first via JSON.stringify(body)</Warning>

After you have verified the signature and the claims, you can be sure the
request came from Upstash and process it accordingly.
