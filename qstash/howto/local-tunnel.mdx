title: "Local Tunnel"
---

QStash requires a publicly available API to send messages to. If you want to
develop locally, you need to run a tunnel. We are planning to offer a native
solution, but for the moment please use a 3rd party tunnel.

## ngrok

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a free service, that provides you with a public
endpoint and forwards all traffic to your localhost.

### Sign up

Create a new account on
[dashboard.ngrok.com/signup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and follow the
[instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to download the
ngrok CLI and connect your account:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken XXX
```

### Start the tunnel

Choose the port where your application is running. Here I'm forwarding to port
3000, because Next.js is using it.

```bash
$ ngrok http 3000

```

### Publish a message

Now copy the `Forwarding` url and use it as destination in QStash. Make sure to
add the path of your API at the end. (`/api/webhooks` in this case)

```
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://e02f-2a02-810d-af40-5284-b139-58cc-89df-b740.eu.ngrok.io/api/webhooks'
```

### Debug

In case messages are not delivered or something else doesn't work as expected,
you can go to [http://127.0.0.1:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040) to see what ngrok
is doing.
