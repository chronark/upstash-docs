Deleting schedules can be done using the
[schedules api](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/openapi#tag/Schedules).

```
curl -XDELETE \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/schedules/<schedule_id>'
```

Deleting a schedule does not stop existing messages from being delivered. It
only stops the schedule from creating new messages.

## Schedule ID

If you don't know the schedule ID, you can get a list of all of your schedules
from [here](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/openapi#tag/Schedules/operation/listSchedules).

```
curl \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/schedules'
```
