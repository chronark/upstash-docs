To debug the logs, first you need to understand the different states a task can
be in.

## Lifecycle of a Task

When you publish a message, for each destination a new task is created. To
understand the lifecycle of each task, we'll look at the following chart:

Either you or a previously setup schedule will publish a message and a new task
will be `created`. Depending on the delay (if you set any), the task will be
`planned` for immediate execution or for later.

When a task is ready for execution, it will be become `active` and a delivery to
your API is attempted.

If you API responds with a status code between `200 - 299`, the task is
considered successful and will be marked as `Delivered`.

Otherwise the task is being retried if there are any retries left and the task
goes back to `planned`. If all retries are exhausted, the task has `failed`.
Failed tasks are considered to be undeliverable and there is probably a problem
with your API.

## Console

Head over to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and go to
the `Logs` tab, where you can see all your tasks.

## Example

Here is a task fetched from `https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/tasks`

```
curl  https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/tasks -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>"
```

                "error": "HTTP status 500",
                "state": "error",
                // ...
            },
            {
                "time": 1657880210009,
                "state": "active",
                // ...
            },
            {
                "time": 1657880210012,
                "state": "planned",
                "nextDeliveryAt": 1657880210009
                // ...,
            },
            {
                "time": 1657880209199,
                "state": "created",
                // ...
            }
        ]
    },
    { ... }
]
```

The logs are ordered in reverse chronological order, so the lowest log is the
first one. As you can see, the task was created and the first delivery attempt
has failed. After a delay, a second attempt was made and succeeded.
