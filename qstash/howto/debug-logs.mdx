To debug the logs, first you need to understand the different states a message can
be in.

## Lifecycle of a Task

When you publish a message, for each destination a new task is created. To
understand the lifecycle of each task, we'll look at the following chart:

Either you or a previously setup schedule will create a message.

When a message is ready for execution, it will be become `ACTIVE` and a delivery to
your API is attempted.

If you API responds with a status code between `200 - 299`, the task is
considered successful and will be marked as `DELIVERED`.

Otherwise the message is being retried if there are any retries left and moves to `RETRY`. If all retries are exhausted, the task has `FAILED` and the message will be moved to the DLQ.


## Console

Head over to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and go to
the `Logs` tab, where you can see the latest events.
