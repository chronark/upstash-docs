title: "Create URL Groups and Endpoints"
---

QStash allows you to group multiple APIs together into a single namespace,
called a `URL Group`. Read more about URL Groups [here](/qstash/features/topics).

There are two ways to create endpoints and URL Groups: The UI and the REST API.

## UI

Go to [console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and click
on the `URL Groups` tab. Afterwards you can create a new URL Group by giving it a name.
Keep in mind that topic names are restricted to alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen
and dot characters.

After creating the topic, you can add endpoints to it:

## API

You can create a topic and endpoint using the [console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) or [REST API](/qstash/api/topics/add-endpoint).

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/topics/:topicName/endpoints \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "endpoints": [
      {
        "name": "endpoint1",
        "url": "https://example.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "endpoint2",
        "url": "https://somewhere-else.com"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
```typescript Typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const topics = client.topics();
await topics.addEndpoints({
  name: "topicName",
  endpoints: [
    { name: "endpoint1", url: "https://example.com" },
    { name: "endpoint2", url: "https://somewhere-else.com" },
  ],
});
```
```python Python
from upstash_qstash import QStash

qstash = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
qstash.url_group.upsert_endpoints(
    url_group="url-group-name",
    endpoints=[
        {"name": "endpoint1", "url": "https://example.com"},
        {"name": "endpoint2", "url": "https://somewhere-else.com"},
    ],
)
```
