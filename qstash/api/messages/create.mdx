## Request

<ParamField path="destination" type="string" required>
  Destination can either be a topic name or id that you configured in the
  Upstash console, or a valid url where the message gets sent to. Make sure the
  url is prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="body" type="string">
  The raw request message passed to the endpoints as is
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Content-Type" type="string" >
ContentType is the MIME type of the message.

We highly recommend sending a `Content-Type` header along, as this will help
your destination API to understand the content of the message.

For example `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream`,
`text/plain`

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Method" type="string" default="POST" >
	The HTTP method to use when sending a webhook to your API.

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Delay" type="string" >

Delay the message delivery.

Format for this header is a number followed by duration abbreviation, like
`10s`. Available durations are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d`
(days).

example: "50s" | "3m" | "10h" | "1d"

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Retries" type="int" default={3} >
 How often should this messasge be retried in case the destination API is not available.

The total number of deliveries is therefore capped at `1 + retries`

Leave this empty to use the default value, (free tier: 3, paid tier: 5)

The backoff duration in seconds is calculated as follows: `n` is the number of
times the task has been retried.

`min(86400, e ** (2 * n))`

</ParamField>
<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback" type="string" >
You can define a callback url that will be called with the response from the destination API.
Callbacks are experimental, and the API might change in the future!
- The callback url must be prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
- Callbacks are charged as a regular message.
- Callbacks will use the retry setting from the original request.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Forward-*" type="string" >
 You can send custom headers along with your message.

To send a custom header, prefix the header name with `Upstash-Forward-`. We will
strip efix and them to the destination API.

example: "Upstash-Forward-My-Header: my-value" -> "My-Header: my-value"

</ParamField>

## Response

Either `messageId` or `messageIds` is defined, never both.


<ResponseField name="messageId" type="string" >
  The unique id of this message. You receive a single message id when you send a message directly to a url.
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="messageIds" type="string[]" >
  The unique ids of all created messages. This is only returned when you send a message to a topic.
  We're duplicating the message for each endpoint in the topic.
</ResponseField>
