Here’s the revised November 2024 changelog with consistent tone and grammar:

<Update label="November 2024">
- **TS SDK (qstash-js):**
    - Added support for the Anthropics provider and refactored the `api` field of `publishJSON`. See the documentation [here](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/integrations/anthropic).
    - Full changelog, including fixes, is available [here](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/compare/v2.7.14...v2.7.17).
- **Qstash Server:**
    - Fixed a bug in schedule reporting. The Upstash-Caller-IP header now correctly reports the user’s IP address instead of an internal IP for schedules.
    - Validated the scheduleId parameter. The scheduleId must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods.
    - Added filtering support to bulk message cancellation. Users can now delete messages matching specific filters. See Rest API [here](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/api/messages/bulk-cancel).
    - Resolved a bug that caused the DLQ Console to become unusable when data was too large.
    - Fixed an issue with queues that caused them to stop during temporary network communication problems with the storage layer.
</Update>

<Update label="October 2024">
- **TS SDK (qstash-js):**
    - Fixed a bug on qstash-js where we skipped using the next signing key when the current signing key fails to verify the `upstash-signature`. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    - Added resend API. See [here](/qstash/integrations/resend). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    - Added `schedule to queues` feature to the qstash-js. See [here](/qstash/features/schedules#scheduling-to-a-queue). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
- **Console:**
    - Optimized the console by trimming event bodies, reducing resource usage and enabling efficient querying of events with large payloads.
- **Qstash Server:**
    - Began development on a new architecture to deliver faster event processing on the server.
    - Added more fields to events in the [REST API](/qstash/api/events/list), including `Timeout`, `Method`, `Callback`, `CallbackHeaders`, `FailureCallback`, `FailureCallbackHeaders`, and `MaxRetries`.
    - Enhanced retry backoff logic by supporting additional headers for retry timing. Along with `Retry-After`, Qstash now recognizes `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset-Tokens` as backoff time indicators. See [here](/qstash/features/retry#retry-after-headers) for more details.
</Update>

<Update label="September 2024">
- Improved performance, resulting in reduced latency for average publish times.
- Set the `nbf` (not before) claim on Signing Keys to 0. This claim specifies the time before which the JWT must not be processed. Previously, this was incorrectly used, causing validation issues when there were minor clock discrepancies between systems.
- Fixed queue name validation. Queue names must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods, consistent with other API resources.
- Resolved bugs related to  [overwriting a schedule](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/schedules#overwriting-an-existing-schedule).
</Update>
