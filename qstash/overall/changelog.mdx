<Warning>Workflow changelogs are [here](/workflow/changelog)</Warning>

<Update label="October 2024">
- Added resend API. See [here](/qstash/integrations/resend). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
- Fixed a bug on qstash-js where we skipped using the next signing key when the current signing key fails to verify the `upstash-signature`. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
- Added `schedule to queues` feature to the qstash-js. See [here](/qstash/features/schedules#scheduling-to-a-queue). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
- Optimized the console by trimming event bodies, reducing resource usage and enabling efficient querying of events with large payloads.
- Began development on a new architecture to deliver faster event processing on the server.
- Added more fields to events in the [REST API](/qstash/api/events/list), including `Timeout`, `Method`, `Callback`, `CallbackHeaders`, `FailureCallback`, `FailureCallbackHeaders`, and `MaxRetries`.
- Enhanced retry backoff logic by supporting additional headers for retry timing. Along with `Retry-After`, Qstash now recognizes `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset-Tokens` as backoff time indicators. See [here](/qstash/features/retry#retry-after-headers) for more details.
</Update>

<Update label="September 2024">
- Improved performance, resulting in reduced latency for average publish times.
- Set the `nbf` (not before) claim on Signing Keys to 0. This claim specifies the time before which the JWT must not be processed. Previously, this was incorrectly used, causing validation issues when there were minor clock discrepancies between systems.
- Fixed queue name validation. Queue names must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods, consistent with other API resources.
- Resolved bugs related to  [overwriting a schedule](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/schedules#overwriting-an-existing-schedule).
</Update>
