\* Max Requests per Second is the maximum number of requests you can make to our
API before receiving a 429 response. If you need a higher limit, contact us.

<Note>
  Most of the above are soft limits, [contact](mailto:support@upstash.com) us if
  you have custom needs.
</Note>

## Free tier

The free tier includes **500 Messages per day**. Afterwards we will no longer
accept new requests.

## Pay as You Go

Upstash limits your monthly usage for QStash to daily 500,000 in pay-as-you-go
plan. If you are expecting to exceed this limit, contact us for the Enterprise
plan.

## Enterprise

In the enterprise plan, we give you a fixed price for higher throughput needs.
We reserve isolated resource to guarantee the scalability for high volumes. Here
the Enterprise plans and prices:

| Plan            | Max Messages per Day | Price (per month) |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Enterprise 1M   | 1M                   | $180              |
| Enterprise 10M  | 10M                  | $420              |
| Enterprise 100M | 100M                 | $1800             |

<Note>
  Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards you can cancel any
  time.

## Examples:

### Publish to single API endpoint

1. You make a request to `/v1/publish/<your-api-url>`
2. We make an HTTP request to your API and it returns a 500 status code
3. After some time we retry to deliver the request and it succeeds

In total, you would be charged for 1 message.

#### Example "every hour"

When your schedule triggers every hour, at the end of the month this would be
around `24 * 30 = 720` requests.

### Publish to topic

Let's assume you have a [topic](/qstash/features/topics) and 2 endpoints (`A`
and `B`) subscribed to it.

1. You make a request to `/v1/publish/<your-topic>`
2. We make an HTTP request to each of your endpoints.

In total this would be 2 messages.
