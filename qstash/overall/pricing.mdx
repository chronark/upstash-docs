## Free tier

The free tier includes **500 Messages per day**. Afterwards we will no longer
accept new requests.

## Pay as You Go

Upstash limits your monthly usage for QStash to daily 500,000 in pay-as-you-go
plan. If you are expecting to exceed this limit, contact us for the Enterprise
plan.

## Pro / Enterprise

We give you a fixed price for higher throughput needs and custom quotas.
We reserve isolated resource to guarantee the scalability for high volumes. Here

| Plan               | Pro 1M | Pro 10M | Enterprise                               |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Max Messages / Day | 1M     | 10M     | 100M                                     |

| Price / Month      | \$180  | \$420   | [Contact Us](mailto:support@upstash.com) |


<Note>
  Pro and Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards you can cancel any
  time.

## Examples:

### Publish to single API endpoint

1. You make a request to `/v2/publish/<your-api-url>`
2. We make an HTTP request to your API and it returns a 500 status code
3. After some time we retry to deliver the message and it succeeds

In total, you would be charged for 1 message.

#### Example "every hour"

When your schedule triggers every hour, at the end of the month this would be
around `24 * 30 = 720` billed messages.

### Publish to topic

Let's assume you have a [topic](/qstash/features/topics) and 2 endpoints (`A`
and `B`) subscribed to it.

1. You make a request to `/v2/publish/<your-topic>`
2. We make an HTTP request to each of your endpoints.

In total this would be 2 messages.
