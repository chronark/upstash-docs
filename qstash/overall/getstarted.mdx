## Introduction

QStash is an HTTP based messaging and scheduling solution for the serverless and
edge runtimes.

-   100% serverless, no stateful connections required. Messages are pushed to your
    API.
-   At-least-once delivery guaranteed to any public API
-   Pubsub via [topics](/qstash/features/topics)
-   [Delay](/qstash/features/delay) message delivery
-   Message [deduplication](/qstash/features/deduplication)
-   [Scheduling](/qstash/features/schedules) via CRON

## Requirements

### 1. Public API

Make sure you have a publicly available HTTP API that you want to send your
messages to. If you don't, you can use something like
[requestcatcher.com](https://requestcatcher.com/) or
[webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to try it out.

### 2. Get your token

Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the
`QSTASH_TOKEN`.

## Publish a message

A message can be any shape or form: json, xml, binary, anything, that can be
transmitted in the http request body. We do not impose any restrictions other
than a size limit of 1 MB (which can be customized at your request).

In addition to the request body itself, you can also send HTTP headers. Learn
more about this in the [message publishing section](/qstash/howto/publishing).

```
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://<your-api-url>'
```

## Check Response

You should receive a response with a unique message ID.

```json
{
    "messageId": "msg_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## Check Message Status

Head over to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and go to the
`Logs` tab where you can see your message activities.
