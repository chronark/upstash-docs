title: "Delay"

---

When publishing a message, you can delay it for a certain amount of time before
it will be delivered to your API. The maximum delay is 90 days.

## Relative Delay

Delay a message by a certain amount of time relative to the time the message was
published.

The format for the duration is `<number><unit>`. Here are some examples:

- `10s` = 10 seconds
- `1m` = 1 minute
- `30m` = half an hour
- `2h` = 2 hours
- `7d` = 7 days

You can send this duration inside the `Upstash-Delay` header.

```
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Delay: 1m" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/...'
```

:::warning

`Upstash-Delay` will get overridden by `Upstash-Not-Before` header when both are
used together.

:::

## Absolute Delay

Delay a message until a certain time in the future. The format is a unix
timestamp in seconds, based on the UTC timezone.

You can send the timestamp inside the `Upstash-Not-Before` header.

```
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Not-Before: 1657104947" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/...'
```

:::info

`Upstash-Not-Before` will override the `Upstash-Delay` header when both are used
together.

## Delays in Schedules

When adding a delay either via `Upstash-Delay` or `Upstash-Not-Before`, the
delay will affect the messages that will be created by the schedule and not the
schedule itself.

For example when you create a new schedule with a delay of `30s`, the messages
will be created when the schedule triggers but only delivered after 30 seconds.
