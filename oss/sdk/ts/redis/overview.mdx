`@upstash/redis` is an HTTP/REST based Redis client for TypeScript, built on top
of [Upstash REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/features/restapi).

You can find the Github Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis).

It is the only connectionless (HTTP based) Redis client and designed for:

-   Serverless functions (AWS Lambda ...)
-   Cloudflare Workers (see
    [the example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/master/examples/cloudflare-workers))
-   Fastly Compute@Edge (see
    [the example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/master/examples/fastly))
-   Next.js, Jamstack ...
-   Client side web/mobile applications
-   WebAssembly
-   and other environments where HTTP is preferred over TCP.
