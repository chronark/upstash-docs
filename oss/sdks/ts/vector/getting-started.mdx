## Install

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install @upstash/vector
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm add @upstash/vector
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash vector client: an REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through a configuration object. Find your configuration values in the console dashboard at [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/).

#### Using environment variables

The environment variables used to configure the client are the following. You can follow [this guide](/vector/overall/getstarted) to retrieve credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, the client constructor does not require any additional arguments.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const index = new Index();
```

#### Using a configuration object

If you prefer to pass configuration in code, the constructor accepts a config object containing the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple projects, each with a different configuration.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const index = new Index({
  url: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL>",
  token: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN>",
});
```
