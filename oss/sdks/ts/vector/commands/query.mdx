title: Query
---

The query method is designed to retrieve the most similar vectors from the index, using the specific distance metric defined for your index. This method supports a variety of options to configure the query to your needs.

<Note>
  The dimension of the query vector must match the dimension of your index.
</Note>

## Arguments

<ResponseField name="Payload" type="QueryOptions" required>
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">
    <ResponseField name="vector" type="number[]" required>
      The query vector
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="topK" type="number" required>
      The total number of the vectors that you want to recieve as a query
      result. The response will be sorted based on the distance metric score,
      and `topK` vectors will be returned.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="includeMetadata" type="boolean">
      Whether to include the metadata of the vectors in the response. Setting
      this `true` would be the best practice, since it will make it easier to
      identify the vectors.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="includeVectors" type="boolean">
      The metadata of the vector. This is used to make it easier to identify the
      vector on queries.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="QueryResponse" type="Vector[]" required>
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="string | number" required>
      The ID of the resulting vector.
    </ResponseField>
	<ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
      The score of the vector data, calculated based on the distance metric of your index.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="vector" type="number[]" required>
      The resulting vector.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="metadata" type="Record<string, unknown>">
      The metadata of the vector. This is used to make it easier to identify the
      vector on queries.
    </ResponseField>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>

```typescript Basic
await index.query({ topK: 2, vector: [ ... ]})
/*
{
  matches: [
    {
      id: '6345',
      score: 1.00000012,
      vector: [],
      metadata: {
		sentence: "Upstash is great."
	  }
    },
    {
      id: '1233',
      score: 1.00000012,
      vector: [],
      metadata: undefined
    },
  ],
  namespace: ''
}
*/
```

```typescript Improved Typechecking
type Metadata = {
  title: string,
  genre: 'sci-fi' | 'fantasy' | 'horror' | 'action'
}

const results = await index.query<Metadata>({
  vector: [
    ... // query embedding
  ],
  includeVectors: true,
  topK: 1,
})

if (results[0].metadata) {
  // Since we passed the Metadata type parameter above,
  // we can interact with metadata fields without having to
  // do any typecasting.
  const { title, genre } = results[0].metadata;
  console.log(`The best match in fantasy was ${title}`)
}
```
