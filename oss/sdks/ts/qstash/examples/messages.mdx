title: Messages
---

Messages are removed from the database shortly after they're delivered, so you
will not be able to retrieve a message after. This endpoint is intended to be used
for accessing messages that are in the process of being delivered/retried.

#### Retrieve a message

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const messages = client.messages();
const msg = await messages.get("msgId");
```

#### Cancel/delete a message

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const messages = client.messages();
const msg = await messages.delete("msgId");
```
