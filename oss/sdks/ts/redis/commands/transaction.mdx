You can use transactions or pipelines with the `multi` or `pipeline`  method.

Transactions are executed atomically, while pipelines are not. In pipelines you can execute multiple commands at once, but other commands from other clients can be executed in between.

<CodeGroup>

```ts Pipeline
const p = redis.pipeline()
p.set('foo', 'bar')
p.get('foo')
const res = await p.exec()
```



```ts Transaction
const tx = redis.multi()
tx.set('foo', 'bar')
tx.get('foo')
const res = await tx.exec()
```
