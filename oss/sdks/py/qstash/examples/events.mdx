#### Get all events with pagination using cursor

Since there can be a large number of events, they are paginated.
You can go through the results using the `cursor`.

```python
all_events = []
cursor = None
while True:
	res = client.events({"cursor": cursor})
	print(len(res["events"]))
	all_events.extend(res["events"])
	cursor = res.get("cursor")
	if cursor is None:
		break
```
