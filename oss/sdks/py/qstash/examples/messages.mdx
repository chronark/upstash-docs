title: Messages

<Info>
  You can run the async code by importing `AsyncQStash` from `upstash_qstash`
  and awaiting the methods.
</Info>

Messages are removed from the database shortly after they're delivered, so you
will not be able to retrieve a message after. This endpoint is intended to be used
for accessing messages that are in the process of being delivered/retried.

#### Retrieve a message

```python
from upstash_qstash import QStash

qstash = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
msg = qstash.message.get("<msg-id>")
```

#### Cancel/delete a message

```python
from upstash_qstash import QStash

qstash = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
qstash.message.cancel("<msg-id>")
```
