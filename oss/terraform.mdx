title: Upstash Terraform Provider
---

 [Upstash Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/upstash/upstash/latest).

## Installation

```hcl

terraform {
  required_providers {
    upstash = {
      source = "upstash/upstash"
      version = "x.x.x"
    }
  }
}

provider "upstash" {
  email = var.email
  api_key  = var.api_key
}
```

`email` is your registered email in Upstash.

`api_key` can be generated from Upstash Console. For more information please check our [docs](https://docs.upstash.com/howto/developerapi).

## Create Database Using Terraform

Here example code snippet that creates database:

```hcl
resource "upstash_redis_database" "redis" {
  database_name = "db-name"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  tls = "true"
  multi_zone = "false"
}
```
## Import Resources From Outside of Terraform
To import resources created outside of the terraform provider, simply create the resource in .tf file as follows:
```hcl
resource "upstash_redis_database" "redis" {}
```
after this, you can run the command: 
```
terraform import upstash_redis_database.redis <db-id>
```

Above example is given for an Upstash Redis database. You can import all of the resources by changing the resource type and providing the resource id.

You can check full spec and [doc from here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/upstash/upstash/latest/docs).
